The overall process for Quantamental Trading should go in this order:

Take Alpha factors amongst a bag of stocks

After finding weights for each ticker from alpha factors:

Analyze last 2 10-K's or last 8 Quarterlys (Quantative analysis from quarterly reports and earnings)

Analyze Sentiment towards winningest winners from alpha factors

Send tickers from top 10-K's analysis through:

Stocktwits about tickers from last 2 weeks (Fundamental Analysis sentiment from social media)

Tweets about tickers from last 2 weeks (Fundamental Analysis sentiment from social media)

Output most postive and negative from analysis

send most postitive and negative to buy short orders

Normally I would only use Fundamental trading to find equities selections. Game Theory would dictact that it would leave my potfolio decisions lacking. While Fundamentals may be correct, timing the overall strength of the given underlying equity would leave you vulnerable to buying high. Adding in Quantative finance helps reduce risks of buying high, alerting underlying signals of better entry points then just going in only using fundamentals.
